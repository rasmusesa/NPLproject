# Character Analysis Tool
Created by Rasmus Kurtti Y63273846

This project provides a character analysis tool designed to perform natural language processing (NLP) tasks on character dialogue data, specifically aimed at understanding character vocabulary, sentiment, and dialogue patterns in textual corpora.

## Requirements

- I used Python 3.12, but I am not sure if it works with other versions without problems
- See `requirements.txt` for required packages

## Usage

1. run `python main.py`.
2. If you want to do one task at a time there is no UI, you should comment lines on main()

## Future Work

I have lots of issues with torchMoji so it is not implemented as I originally planned. On raport there is more explanation task is done. There is too error in a triangle-based illustration on sentiments, but sentiment scores can be seen print.
