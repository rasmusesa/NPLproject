# Character Analysis Tool
Created by Rasmus Kurtti Y63273846

This project provides a character analysis tool designed to perform natural language processing (NLP) tasks on character dialogue data, specifically aimed at understanding character vocabulary, sentiment, and dialogue patterns in textual corpora.

## Requirements

- I used Python 3.12, but I am not sure if it works with other versions without problems
- See `requirements.txt` for required packages

## Usage

1. run `python main.py`.
2. If you want to do one task at a time there is no UI, you should comment lines on main()

## Future Work

I have encountered several issues with torchMoji, and it has not been implemented as originally planned. The report provides further explanation, and the task has been completed. There is an error in the triangle-based illustration of sentiments, but the sentiment scores can still be seen when printed.
